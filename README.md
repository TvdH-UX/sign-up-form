# sign-up-form
This project is about creating a sign up form for an imaginary service.

During this project, I will implement the following freshly learned methods regarding HMTL forms and styling with intermediate CSS concepts:
- HTML forms and validation
- Default styles for better cross-browser experiences
- CSS units
- Using custom fonts
- Advanced selectors (i.e. pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements)
- CSS functions
- Custom properties (CSS variables)
